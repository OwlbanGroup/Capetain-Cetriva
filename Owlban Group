## URL Encoding

URL encoding, also known as percent encoding, is a mechanism for encoding information in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). It is used to encode characters that may not be allowed in a URL or that have special meanings in a URL.

### Reserved Characters

Characters such as `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, `[`, `]`, `@`, `!`, `$`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `;`, `=` are reserved for special purposes in URLs. If these characters need to be included in a URL as data, they must be encoded.

### Non-ASCII Characters

Characters outside the ASCII set (e.g., characters with accents, non-Latin characters) must be encoded.

### Space

The space character is encoded as `%20` or `+`.

### Encoding Process

Each character is converted to its corresponding ASCII value, and then represented as a percent sign `%` followed by two hexadecimal digits.

For example:

- The space character `` is encoded as `%20`.
- The character `#` is encoded as `%23`.
- The character `?` is encoded as `%3F`.

### Example

Here is an example of a URL before and after encoding:

**Before Encoding:**

```plaintext
https://example.com/path/to resource?name=John Doe&age=30
```

**After Encoding:**

```plaintext
https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30
```

In the provided URL `file:///C:/Users/owlba/Downloads/Capitian%20Centrva.html#`, the space character in the file name is correctly encoded as `%20`. The `#` at the end is a fragment identifier, which is used to specify a section within the resource. If it is not needed, it can be removed.

### Investment Fund

An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

- Hire professional investment managers, who may offer better returns and more adequate risk management.
- Benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs.
- Increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

### Types of Investment Funds

1. **Mutual Funds**: Pooled funds from many investors to purchase securities.
2. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: Traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.
3. **Hedge Funds**: Private, actively managed investment funds.
4. **Pension Funds**: Retirement funds that are invested on behalf of employees.
// JavaScript example to decode a URL
const encodedURL = "<https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30>";
const decodedURL = decodeURIComponent(encodedURL);

console.log(decodedURL); // Output: `https://example.com/path/to resource?name=John Doe&age=30`

### Python Example to Decode a URL

```python
import urllib.parse

encoded_url = "https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30"
decoded_url = urllib.parse.unquote(encoded_url)

print(decoded_url)  # Output: https://example.com/path/to resource?name=John Doe&age=30
```

import urllib.parse

encoded_url = "<https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30>"
decoded_url = urllib.parse.unquote(encoded_url)

print(decoded_url)  # Output: <https://example.com/path/to> resource?name=John Doe&age=30### Decoding URLs

To decode a URL, you can use various methods depending on the programming language or tool you are using. Here are examples in JavaScript and Python:

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const encodedURL = "https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30";
const decodedURL = decodeURIComponent(encodedURL);

console.log(decodedURL); // Output: https://example.com/path/to resource?name=John Doe&age=30import urllib.parse

encoded_url = "https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30"
decoded_url = urllib.parse.unquote(encoded_url)

print(decoded_url)  # Output: https://example.com/path/to resource?name=John Doe&age=30# Capetain Cetriva
