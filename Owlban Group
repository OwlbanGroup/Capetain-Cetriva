## URL Encoding

URL encoding, also known as percent encoding, is a mechanism for encoding information in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). It is used to encode characters that may not be allowed in a URL or that have special meanings in a URL.

### Reserved Characters

Characters such as `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, `[`, `]`, `@`, `!`, `$`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `;`, `=` are reserved for special purposes in URLs. If these characters need to be included in a URL as data, they must be encoded.

### Non-ASCII Characters

Characters outside the ASCII set (e.g., characters with accents, non-Latin characters) must be encoded.

### Space

The space character is encoded as `%20` or `+`.

### Encoding Process

Each character is converted to its corresponding ASCII value, and then represented as a percent sign `%` followed by two hexadecimal digits.

For example:

- The space character `` is encoded as `%20`.
- The character `#` is encoded as `%23`.
- The character `?` is encoded as `%3F`.

### Example

Here is an example of a URL before and after encoding:

**Before Encoding:**

```plaintext
https://example.com/path/to resource?name=John Doe&age=30
```

**After Encoding:**

```plaintext
https://example.com/path/to%20resource?name=John%20Doe&age=30
```

In the provided URL `file:///C:/Users/owlba/Downloads/Capitian%20Centrva.html#`, the space character in the file name is correctly encoded as `%20`. The `#` at the end is a fragment identifier, which is used to specify a section within the resource. If it is not needed, it can be removed.
